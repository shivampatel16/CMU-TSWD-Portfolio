						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Dataset Explanation üìù</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The data for the general government debt for the various countries is open source and 
								is collected from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
							</li>
							<li>
								The general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government 
								in a country as a percentage of its GDP. This is a crucial indicator of the financial sustainability 
								of the government.
							</li>
							<li>
								The data is reported yearly for each country and ranges from 1995 to 2021. For some years, 
								the government debt to GDP ratio was not reported for a few countries. 
							</li>
							<li>
								A few columns from the downloaded data were irrelevant, as they all were filled with the 
								same values, top to bottom. Hence, these rows were not considered in the upcoming visualizations 
								below. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Insights (very general) from the Visualization üìä</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The above (guided) visualization shows a simple <i>Bar Chart</i> visualization 
								depicting the government debt across various countries for the year 2021. It was 
								built using OECD.
							</li>
							<li>
								We learn that Japan's debt is way higher than that of other countries for 2021, followed 
								by Greece and Italy. On the lower end, Estonia and Luxembourg have the most negligible debts. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The remaining countries are sorted based on increasing government debts from Estonia to
								Japan. OECD helped build an interactive bar chart wherein hovering over particular bars 
								would highlight government debt (as a % of GDP) for that particular country.

						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Insights from the Visualization üìä</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The above (guided) visualization shows a <i>Grid of Line Charts</i> visualization 
								depicting the government debt across various countries for the period 1995 to 2021. 
								It was built as an initial step for using and getting to know Flourish. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The grid has multiple small line charts (one for each country). The lines depict the 
								change in Debt to GDP ratio from 1995 to 2021 for every country. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Being small line charts with a lot of information, it is hard to interpret the exact message; 
								however, on a general overview, I can see that Japan (JPN) is going through tough times. It 
								shows the highest increase in Government Debt from 1995 to 2021 and has the highest 
								government debts in the world for 2021. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Information from the line charts of other countries is quite less interpretable from the complexity
								of the graph. However, being an interactive visualization, one can hover over the lines to know 
								the Government Debt to GDP ratio for a country for the desired year.

						<p style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 3px;">USA faces the highest rise in Debt-to-GDP ratio among the top three study destinations</p> <br>

						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Choice of Visualization üìà</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The grid of lines chart in Visualization 1 had a lot of things to convey in
								the small space. With a considerable number of countries and a small line chart 
								for each one of them, it wasn't easy to compare the data for each country and 
								extract the relevant information. 
							</li>
							<li>
								A line chart is helpful with such data, which has numerical values varying with 
								time. However, the miniature versions of many line charts in Visualization 1 were
								not helpful. Hence, my first thought was to subset the data and focus on
								particular countries to convey the relevant information. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Being an international student in the USA, I decided to visualize government
								debts of the top higher study destinations (countries) for Indian students. 
								Based on the ground reality of Indian students, I shortlisted to visualize
								the following countries: United States of America (USA), Canada, Australia, 
								United Kingdom (UK), France, and Germany. It would help aspiring Indian students
								compare the government debts of the countries they are looking forward to for
								pursuing their higher education.
							</li>
							<li>
								I had six countries and wanted to show how their government debts varied from 
								1995 to 2021. A simple static line chart with six lines (one for each country)
								would have been sufficient; however, upon exploration, I came across the 
								Line Chart Race visualization, and it seemed perfect! 
							</li>
							<li>
								Contrary to showing the six static lines, the Line Chart Race visualization
								will form them dynamically, and it would be pleasing to the eyes of the 
								audience. Additionally, it has the 'Ranks' tab to show how the six countries' 
								rankings change over the years. Moreover, the 'Replay' button adds a cherry on 
								the top :)
							</li>
							<li>
								The interactive highlight option in the Line Chart Race visualization is also
								appealing. It helps highlight a line for a particular country to understand its
								trend better. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Choice of Color üé®</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Initially, I used the six default colors for the lines (one for each line).
								However, with the default color choice, the graph looked complex, and I could
								not get the message out. Thus, I decided to highlight the top three study 
								destinations for Indian students - USA, Canada, and Australia, and 
								hide the remaining three countries in the background (using the all-time 
								favorite for such use cases - the gray!). 
							</li>
							<li>
								For USA, Canada, and Australia, I colored their lines with one of their 
								national colors. Each of them had multiple national colors. Hence, I chose
								ones that would be distinct from the others and would be visually appealing 
								(USA - Blue; Canada - Red; Australia - Gold). 
							</li>
							<li>
								The country names and government debts for the respective years were colored 
								the same color as the six lines to display consistency. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Crafting for Clarity üí¨</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								I expanded the abbreviated names of the six countries. However, the USA's long name did 
								not fit well. Moreover, its abbreviated name was self-explanatory. Hence, I decided to 
								keep the abbreviations (for countries) that are more famous and could be easily understood 
								and expand the names for the rest.
							</li>
							<li>
								The X-axis and Y-axis were intentionally not labeled as they were self-explanatory from the 
								graph's title and would help avoid redundancy. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Insights from the Visualization üìä</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Among the top three higher study destinations (USA, Canada, Australia) for Indian 
								students, the USA faces the highest rise in government debts across the past years 
								from 1995 to 2021. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Canada, Australia, and Germany have tried to maintain government debts over the past 
								years. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The COVID-19 phase hit every country hard since there was a considerable spike in 
								government debts for each country from 2019 to 2020. However, with recovery from 
								COVID-19 since the start of vaccinations, each of these study destinations has seen 
								a reduction in their government debts. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Upon minute observation, I find that from 1995 to 2021, the UK has seen the highest 
								increase in government debts (among all six study destinations).

							</li>
							<li>
								Since the locations were sorted based on descending average values of the debt-to-

								and Italy had more debt-to-GDP ratio than the other countries.

						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Part 4: Comparing the above Visualizations</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Bar Chart</b>: With the bar chart, I could depict the debt-to-GDP ratio 
								data for only 2021 for the respective countries. It was good, but I could not 
								compare the trend for the debt-to-GDP ratio for the countries from 1995 to 2021. 
								This was a major drawback.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Grid of Line Charts</b>: The grid of line charts, on the contrary, helps to compare
								the trend of the debt-to-GDP ratio for the countries from 1995 to 2021. But with 
								so many countries and different line charts for each one of them, it brought in 
								complexity and made it hard to grasp the message at first sight. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Highlight Tables</b>: The Highlight Tables visualization was more detailed than 
								the Bar Chart and the Grid of Line Charts. It used color coding and sorting to give 
								out the message. Moreover, it had numbers on each cell to show the corresponding debt-
								to-GDP ratio. I feel it was better than the Bar Chart and the Grid of Line Charts as it 
								conveys much more quickly. Such visualization can be helpful in cases where details for 
								each data point are essential, along with conveying the general message. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Line Chart Race</b>: The visualization of the Line Chart Race was quite adequate for 
								the message it had to convey. It was simple, attractive, and pleasing to the eyes. The 
								"race effect" in the lines and the "Ranks" tab helped easily understand the trend in the 
								debt-to-GDP ratio across the years. The color choice was practical as well to further 
								highlight the main message.
