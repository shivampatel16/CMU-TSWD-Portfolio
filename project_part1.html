						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Summary üìù</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								These are challenging times. We are going through a difficult phase of life. The job market is crashing, and there are layoffs all around. Inflation rates are booming in the United States, and finding jobs is getting harder. Are we entering a recession? Maybe. Or maybe not! Many students, especially new grads, may feel hopeless about the future in such a situation. I have seen many students in this situation. But I firmly believe that there is hope. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The primary audience of this project is the master's students at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. Through this project, I wish to highlight the current trends in the job market, primarily focusing on the layoffs that have occurred in 2022. 
							</li>
							<li>
								After highlighting the trends and the current layoff scenario, I emphasize two facts. The first is that unemployment rates have decreased significantly after every recession. The second fact relates to CMU Heinz graduates outperforming the other US graduates (in terms of salaries) over the past years. CMU's Heinz graduates have great potential, and their potential is a big hope for their future! All that is required in these challenging times is consistency and a proper approach. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">User Story and Call To Action üìù</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								As a reader, I want to understand the current job market (layoffs) scenario and the hope that exists for me so that I can be hopeful about my future and stay calm. I can do this by being calm, and consistent and by following a proper job search approach.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Project Structure üìù</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Setup:</b> For the setup, I would highlight a few daunting but authentic facts about the current layoff scenario. These would include the total number of companies that have reported layoffs in 2022, the total number of reported layoffs, and the percentage of the workforce that has been impacted so far. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Conflict:</b> I would move on with visualizing the trends in the layoffs. I would highlight the industries that have been impacted, the proportion of layoffs in the private and public sectors, the cities whose companies have seen the highest layoffs, and the increasing trend of layoffs month by month in 2022. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Resolution:</b> Despite the above, there is hope. I highlight the fact that unemployment rates have decreased significantly after every recession. And I put forward that CMU's Heinz graduates have great potential compared to the other US graduates. This is the least possible ray of hope that I want current Heinz graduates (who are too worried about their future) to hold onto.

						A few daunting but authentic facts about the current layoff scenario. It would help understand the ground reality.

						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">2. Conflict </p>
						Visualizing the trends in the layoff season - Industries that have been impacted, the proportion of layoffs in the private and public sectors, the cities whose companies have seen the highest layoffs, and the increasing trend of layoffs month by month in 2022.
						
						
						<br><br>
						We learn that the monthly layoffs in the US in 2022 have exponentially increased in the final quarter. 
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=75% width=75% src='img/p1_monthly.JPG' alt='Original Batting'/></center>

						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11929017"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
						
						<br><br>

						I plan to highlight the industries that have seen the highest layoffs. Initially, I decided to show the top few industries whose companies have seen the maximum layoffs. Hence, I came up with the following bar chart. But after getting my hands dirty in Flourish, I designed the word cloud that follows. However, it seemed a bit messy so I changed it to a tree map showing the showing more industries that have been affected (along with highlighting the top 4). I would not let the word clound go in vain. I would probably take its screenshot and use it in my final short hand.

						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/11929809"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
						
						<br>
						Next, we learn that the public sector has been affected a lot more than the private sector. On a side note, the rise in the private sector is also due to Twitter turing private in the recent weeks after Elon Musk bought it.
						<br><br>

						<br>
						It is required to know the cities that have been greatly affected by the layoffs. From the following Circle Hierarchy chart, we learn that almost all major cities in the US have been affected by the layoffs, with the tech hubs being on the top.
						<br><br>
						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/11928801"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">3. Resolution </p>
						Despite the above daunting trends and facts, there is hope. In the final section, I bring to light the fact that unemployment rates have decreased significantly after every recession. And I put forward that CMU's Heinz graduates have great potential compared to the other US graduates. This is the least possible ray of hope that I want current Heinz graduates (who are too worried about their future) to hold onto.
						
						<br><br>
						From the below chart, we see that after every dull period of recession where the unemployment rates increase, the US sees a significant decrease in unemployment. This is a positive sign and a small ray of hope. If we are to enter a recession, everyone would be in it, but things would be fine after that. 
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=75% width=75% src='img/p1_rec.JPG' alt='Original Batting'/></center>
						
						<br><br>
						The biggest ray of hope that I wish the students to go away with is to understand their potential that they have developed at CMU! The below line chart clearly indicates that CMU's Heinz graduates earn much more than the other masters degreen holder in the US.

						<ul>
							<li>
								This is my main data source for analysing the layoff trends in the US in 2022. 
							</li>
							<li>
								It has the name of the company, number of reported layoffs by the company, % of workforce impacted in the company, its headquarters, its status (private or public), the date it announced the layoffs and its industry.  
							</li>
							<li>
								The original data source was a bit messy. For example, the entire date was in one cell and multiple industries were present in one cell. I separated these into different columns and generalized the data further by replacing 'AI' with 'Artificial Intelligence', 'IT' with 'Information Technology', 'Ecommerce' with 'E-Commerce' and 'AR' with 'Augmented Reality'.

								I use this data source to get the median salary of the different programs at the Heinz College at CMU over the past years from 2014 to 2021.

							<li>
								It is used to generate the line chart of the median salaries which are compared with the median salaries of the masters students in US in general.

						<ul>
							<li>
								Moving forward, I am planning to polish-up my visualizations. My main focus would be to develop digitial interactive visualization for the 'Unemployment Rates in the US' chart. Due to time constraints, I could not come up with a digital interactive version at this point in time.  
							</li>
							<li>
								I am also planning to restructure the Circle Hierarchy chart to represent states as the major circles and cities as minor circles in the states. I would also try to generalise the industries in the tree map to create sub tree maps if possible. 
							</li>
							<li>
								I would use <b>Shorthand</b> to develop my narrative for the final project.
							</li>
							<li>
								I am planning to mainly use <b>Flourish</b> to develop my final visualizations, but in case if I come up with ideas that are more suitable for <b>Tableau</b>, I have kept it (Tableau) in my toolkit as well. 
							</li>
							<li>
								For developing the narrative for my final project in Shorthand, I am palnning to use attractive license free images by <b>Unsplash</b>.
