						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Step 1: Find a data visualization (with data you can use!)</h2>
						I am a big fan of cricket, especially when it comes to the ICC 
						(International Cricket Council) T20 World Cups and the IPLs (Indian 
						Premier League). The 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup recently concluded
						in Australia on 13th November 2022. Unfortunately, my team (Team 
						India) did not win, but it gave a good fight and made it to the 
						semi-finals! I enjoyed watching the matches in this World Cup.
						<br><br>
						With cricket still in the air these days, and this assignment coming
						up, the best place I thought to search for (bad) visualizations was
						<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/" target="_blank">ESPNcricinfo</a>. It is a 
						sports news website exclusively for the game of cricket. It features 
						cricket articles, cricket news, lives cricket matches and a 
						historical database of cricket matches played from the 18th century 
						to the current times. An additional reason this website was my
						first resource was because I had seen poor visualizations earlier
						on ESPNcricinfo. 
						<br><br> 
						During my exploration, I came across a page titled <i><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522" target="_blank">
						Which top cricket city would win the World Cup?</a></i> First of 
						all, the title of the page itself was confusing since the world cup 
						matches are played between countries and not between cities. Based 
						on the design and critiquing knowledge I have gained so far in the 
						course,	upon glancing thourgh the page, I found some poor and 
						misleading visualizations and decided to work upon one of them for 
						this assignment. 
						<br><br>	
						I planned to work on the visualization titled <i>'Cities with best
						Batting averages'</i> since it has a big area of improvement. But 
						as a <b><span style="color: #50C878">bonus</span></b> üåü, I planned to 
						parallely work on the visualization titled <i>'Cities with best 
						Bowling averages'</i> since the two were quite related and had 
						similar areas of improvement. Both these visualizations are shown 
						below.

						<h5 style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 110px; margin-top: 10px;">Source: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522" target="_blank">ESPNcricinfo</a> </h5>
						
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Dataset Explanation üìù</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The data for these visualizations is open source and 
								describes the batting and bowling performances of the top
								cities in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup.
							</li>
							<li>
								Though the circket World Cups are played among countries, 
								these visualisations focus on a different aspect. 
								They compare the performance of the cities in these 
								countries which is in turn measured by the performance of
								the players that the city produced. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The intended audience for these visualizations (and the 
								data) are people interested in cricket. This is because
								they heaviely contain technical jargon related to 
								cricket which is not easily understandable by people who
								do not have a background in cricket. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The data points in the visualizations are batting average,
								bowling average, runs and wickets. These are cricket heavy
								and can be better understood from the detailed explanation
								given in <a href="https://www.rookieroad.com/cricket/how-does-scoring-work/#:~:text=In%20cricket%2C%20scoring%20depends%20on,as%20many%20runs%20as%20possible." target="_blank">
								this link</a>. However, in simple terms, if you are batting, 
								you try to score as many runs as possible and save your 
								wickets. But if you are bowling, you try to take the wickets
								of the opponent team and make them score as less runs as 
								possible. If you loose your wicket, you are 'out'. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Batting average is the ratio of the total number of runs 
								scored by a player to the number of times the player has 
								been out. Bowling average is the ratio of the numbers of 
								runs conceded by a player to the number of wickets taken 
								by the player. These averages are calculated on a player
								basis and are then averaged (for the players from a given
								city) to find the averages of the respective cities. 
							<li>
								The source of these visualizations do not have a built in 
								data set (in tabular form). However, the data set was easily
								reconstructable based on the values given in the 
								visualizations. Thus, I (easily) recreated the data set
								for building my sketches and the final visualizations in 
								Flourish.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">Citations</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Data Source:  <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522" target="_blank">ESPNcricinfo</a>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Critique the data visualization</h2>
						<br>
						As a part of the assignment, I was required to critique the original
						visualization using Stephen Few's <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf" target="_blank">
						Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile</a>. Stephen proposed 
						seven criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of a data 
						visualization. These seven criteria are divided into two broad 
						categories, namely <i>'Informative'</i> (Usefulness, Completeness, 
						Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness) and <i>'Emotive'</i> . 
						<br><br>
						The metrics under Informative helps measure the effectiveness of the
						visualization in producing understanding to the audience. And the 
						metrics under Emotive helps measure the effectiveness of the 
						visualization in producing useful emotional response to the 
						audience. I critique the original visualizations below.
						
						<br><br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Informative üìä</h2>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">1. Usefulness</p> 
						Is it useful for the intended audience? Does it communicate 
						valuable information?
						
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=80% width=80% src='img/usefulness.JPG'/></center>
						
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The visualizations are useful to the <i>intended</i> audience 
								(cricket lovers), and they communicate relevant information (with 
								additional efforts from the audience). However, they are not 
								the best in conveying the relevant information. 
							</li>
							<li>
								At first site, considering the graphics in the 
								visualizations, it seemed to me that the visualizations 
								were trying to compare the sizes of the 
								famous monuments across the cities! 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">2. Completeness</p> 
						Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it 
						understandable?
						
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=80% width=80% src='img/completeness.JPG'/></center>
						
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The visualizations are lacking in several aspects and thus
								are not complete to convey the entire information. 
							</li>
							<li>
								First of all, the title itself is incomplete. It does not 
								state the year or the cricket tournament for which the 
								visualisations were made. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Futher, they contain irrelevant information which adds to 
								complexity and reduces their completeness. 
								Our main focus is to compare the batting and bowling 
								averages the best cities. Considering this, I do not find
								the details about runs ('Runs') and wickets ('Wkts') 
								appropriate in this context. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Moreover, some of the sentences in the text are not required
								to convey the message that these visualizations aim for. 
								Soem examples of such sentences include the following: 
								<br><br><i>"It is produced some of the most prolific batsman like 
								David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke, Steve Waugh, 
								and Mark Waugh."</i>
								<br><br><i>"The city has produced some very fine bowlers
								like Shane Bond, Richard Hadlee, Matt Henry and Chris 
								Harris."</i>
								<br><br><i>"It is also the birthplace of England's hero
								from the final, Ben Stokes."</i>
							</li>
							<li>
								The large verbage in the visualizations 
								details the message that these visualizations are trying 
								to convey. It directly supports the fact that these 
								visualizations lack clarity and thus are demanding 
								further explanation by using text.  
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">3. Perceptibility</p> 
						Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? 
						Is the visualization type appropriate?  Does it use illogical 
						comparisons?
						
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=80% width=80% src='img/perceptibility.JPG'/></center>
						
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								It took me a <b>lot of effort to grasp the information</b> that
								these visualizations are trying to convey.
							</li>
							<li>
								There is a lot of unnecessary detail in the visualizations. 
								The 3-4 line explanations are not needed. Moreover, the data
								about runs and wickets are not required in the respective
								graphs. Further, the titles of the visualizations are 
								unclear and incomplete. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The chosen <b>visualization type is not appropriate</b> as well. 
								Chosing the graphics of the famous buildings (in the cities)
								to represent the respective cities is not apt in this
								context. First of all, the users might not be aware of the
								buildings. Next, having buildings to represent the cities, 
								adds a historical/monumental touch to the visualizations. 
								As soon as I see famous monuments and values on top of them,
								I am motivated to think that these visualizations are 
								comparing the heights of the famous monuments across the 
								cities. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The buildings are of various sizes and placing the data 
								points above these buildings brings an <b>illogical comparison</b>.
								It is human nature to think that taller objects should have
								more value than shorter objects. However, this does not 
								hold true in this context. At multiple points we observe that taller
								objects (buildings) have lesser values (batting average, 
								bowling average, runs, wickets) than shorter objects. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">4. Truthfulness</p> 
						Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid? Is it 
						representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and 
						truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make 
						comparisions that aren't correct?
						
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=80% width=80% src='img/truthfulness.JPG'/></center>
						
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Being a cricket fan, I find the data to be accuracte; 
								however, I do not find the visualization to be reliable. It
								seems attractive but can be misleading at first sight.
							</li>
							<li>
								The different sized objects (buildings) used to represent 
								the cities (having different bowling and batting averages!)
								highlight comparisons that are not correct and thus 
								misrepresents the data. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The above insights, the incomplete
								titles, multiple irrelevant information, and the heavy use 
								of dark pink and violet (in the background) colors, do not help
								in conveying the message in the most complete and truthful 
								manner.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">5. Intuitiveness</p> 
						Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information? 
						If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on 
						how to interpret it?
						
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=80% width=80% src='img/intuitiveness.JPG'/></center>
						
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								I do not find the visualizations easy to understand since
								they have used graphics (of various sizes) to represent 
								something very simple. The graphics represent famous 
								monuments in the respective cities; however, it would be 
								difficult for the audience (even cricket lovers) to correctly
								identify the monuments. Even, I did not know some of them!
							</li>
							<li>
								Such visualizations are not familiar to a large audience.
								I find the graphics to be distracting and irrelevant for 
								the context and message to be conveyed. Moreover, there is 
								no additional information provided to better interpret the 
								visualizations. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Emotive üíù</h2>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">6. Aesthetics</p> 
						It is interesting/enjoyable to look at?  Is it a good example of 
						what a beautiful data visualization might look like?  Is it 
						somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting 
						to look at?
						
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=80% width=80% src='img/aesthetics.JPG'/></center>
						
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li> 
								At first site, the visualization might come out to be 
								attracitve, but later, it takes a lot of time to get
								value out of these visualizations. 
							<li>
								I find the visualizations to be quite dull with the choice
								of colors. Moreover, there is huge amount of text in them.
							</li>
							<li>
								The abbreviations used to highlight the data points (Eg: 
								'Wkts' and 'Avg') might not be known to a large audience. 
								Having some knowledge about cricket and math, I could 
								figure out that 'Wkts' is 'Wickets' and 'Avg' is 'Average'.
								But this might not hold true for all cricket lovers. 
							</li>
							<li>
								There is a lot of repeatation for each data point. The 
								words 'Runs', 'Avg' and 'Wkts' are respectively repeated
								for each data point. They add to complexity and disturb the 
								aesthetics of the visualizations. The repeatation clearly 
								indicates that the message is not easily conveyed to the 
								audience. 	
							</li>
							<li>
								The background is filled with violet and it makes be feel 
								sleepy üò¥üí§ by staring at it for long! Painting the whole
								background violet was definitely an incorrect choice. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The labels on the x-axis are colored in brown with a violet
								background. They hide properly in the background and 
								unfortunately do not stand out well. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">7. Engagement</p> 
						Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?  Does it 
						inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?				
						
						<br><br>
						<center><img style='display:inline; border-radius: 0%;' height=80% width=80% src='img/engagement.JPG'/></center>
						
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The first look at these visualizations and the fancy 
								graphics of the monuments might catch ones attention but
								in line with the above discussion, they lack so much! 
								The deficiencies (as discussed above) will not easily
								motivate the audience to learn more about the topic or
								dwell deeper into the data. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Being not a great visualization, it is not inspiring the 
								audience to talk more about the data or share it with 
								others. I would not be motivated to forward the link of
								the visualization to anybody. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Overall Observations</h2>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What stood out? üòÉ</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								The graphics of the famous monuments in the cities stood 
								out at first site.
							</li>
							<li>
								The violet background color caught my attention.
							</li>
							<li>
								The dark pink color of the monuments grabbed my attention 
								next. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Finally, the large amount of text made its way to my eyes, 
								before I could start dwelling into what the visualizations
								had to say.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What worked well? ü§©</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								The large graphics of the monuments worked well in catching
								the first attention. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The large font size of titles were (somewhat) effective to 
								convey what the visualizations were about. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The values for each data point. Though they are not 
								properly represented, this worked out well because without 
								them, I think the visualizations would become completely 
								useless. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What did not work well? üòï</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								The background colored in violet. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Incomplete titles of the visualizations. They missed
								the year and tournament for which the data was displayed. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The huge amount of text (large sentences!) in the 
								visualizations trying to convey the message. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Use of graphics of the famous monuments in the cities to
								respectively represent the cities. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Use of dark pink color in the graphics and in the 
								background.
							</li>
							<li>
								Repeatitions in the data points. 'Runs', 'Avg' and 'Wkts' 
								were over and over again!
							</li>
							<li>
								Use of abbreviations (for 'Avg' and 'Wkts') while 
								representing the data points.
							</li>
							<li>
								X-axis labels colored in light brown on top of a dull 
								violet background. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The various heights of the graphical monuments. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The irrelevant details about 'Runs' and 'Wkts' in the 
								respective visualizations. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Placing the data values of top of each graphical monument
								(of various heights).
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What would you do differently? üìù</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								Remove the background color.
							</li>
							<li>
								Update the titles of the visualisations.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use a bar graph instead of graphical monuments to represent
								the data points. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Remove the large sentences from the visualizations.
							</li>
							<li>
								Remove the details about 'Runs' and 'Wkts' from each data
								point. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Color the bars of the bar chart with relevant colors. I 
								am planning to use the national cricket team colors of 
								the respective countries the cities are a part of. It would
								perfectly align with the theme of Cricket World Cup.

								enthusiasts or people who know cricket. 
							</li>
							<li>
								However, I do not think that these visualisations have
								come out to be effective in reaching out to the audience. 
							</li>
							<li>
								If I (being a big cricket fan) was scrolling through my 
								feed and I come across these visualizations, I would not 
								pause and think that these visualizations convey some 
								useful information about cricket. With the graphical 
								monuments and numbers on top of each of them, I would
								think of these as some civic or historical graphs which are 
								trying to compare the heights of various monuments across
								the numerous cities. 
							</li>
							<li>
								At one point, on a broder view, I also thought of these 
								visualizations as some greeting cards of a festival (they
								closely reside with a few cards I sent to my friends this 
								year of the occasion of the famous festival in India - 
								Diwali...ü™î). The monuments are no lesser than 
								some attractive design on a greeting card and the large 
								amount of text suits the greeting message. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Final Thoughts</h2>
						How successful was this method at evaluating the data 
						visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are 
						missing or not being captured here? What would you change? 
						Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, 
						layout, etc.).

						<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								I find the above evaluation and critiquing technique to be
								very effective of the data visualizations I selected. The 
								evaluation method was detailed and helped evaluate various
								aspects of the visualizations. 
							</li>
							<li>
								I find this approach to be better than the Good Charts 
								method. It is mainly because of the fact that this 
								critiquing approach has lot more useful metrics to evaluate
								the visualizations than those used by the Good Charts 
								method. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The Good Charts method guides one from the first 
								sight of the visualization to suggesting what is to be 
								changed in the visualization. The quantitative evaluation 
								then follows for two metrics, namely 'Design Execution' 
								and 'Contextual Awareness'. 
							</li>
							<li>
								I like Stephen Few's approach better because it has lot 
								more quantitative evaluations which cover multiple aspects 
								of the visualizations. Further, all the quantitative 
								evaluations can be placed in one chart to get a better 
								understanding of the visualizations being evaluated. 
							</li>
							
							<br>
							<b>Recommendations:</b>
							<br><br>
							<li>
								As a recommendation, I would suggest adding <b>'Color'</b>
								as an additional metric under the 'Emotive' category. 
							</li>
							<li>
								I understand that we are evaluating <i>'Aesthetics'</i>, 
								but I believe that <i>Aesthetics</i> is a much broder 
								umbrella as compared to <i>Color</i>. No doubt, we would 
								evaluate <i>Color</i> when we are evaluating 
								<i>Aesthetics</i>, but <i>Color</i> would be a small 
								part of this evaluation. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<i>Aesthetics</i> would measure much more, including 
								orientation, layout, visual appeal, color, choice of 
								visualization, size, shape, etc.
							</li>
							<li>
								<i>Color</i> on the other end, would evaluate a very 
								specific and extremely important aspect of the 
								visualizations. Such specific evaluation of a particular
								and important aspect of the visualizations could also
								help drive the focus during the redesign phase of the
								visualization. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br><br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Step 3: Sketch out a solution</h2>
						
						To better convey the message of the original visualizations, I 
						decided to incorporate the following changes in my initial sketches:
						
						<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Type of Visualization</b>: 
								I changed the visualization type to bar charts and tree maps
								since they are much simpler and easy to understand as 
								compared to the complex and disturbing graphical monuments 
								in the original	visualizations. However, upon comparing the 
								bar charts and tree maps, I prefer going forward with bar charts, but
								I thought to decide upon this after testing them out with the interviewees.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Title</b>: 
								I changed the titles of the charts to make them	more clear 
								and effective in conveying the main takeaway to the audience.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Irrelevant Information</b>:
								I removed the irrelevant information from the charts 
								including the long sentences and the repeated text ('Runs', 
								'Wkts' and 'Avg') for each data point.
								
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Color</b>:
								This was an interesting decision! After quite some thought, 
								I have colored the bars (in the bar chart) and areas (in the
								treemap) of the cities with their respective national 
								cricket team colors. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Background Color</b>: 
								The background color in the original visualizations was not 
								required and hence I have removed it in my sketches. It 
								has made the sketches much more appealing. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Legend</b>: 
								Since I have colored the bars/areas based on the national cricket
								team colors of the cities, I thought it would be better to 
								include a legend describing the colors of the countries. It 
								would help the audience who is not well versed with the 
								national cricket team colors of the cities. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						After incorporating the above changes, I have sketched multiple
						wireframes for both the main (batting averages across the cities) and 
						the bonus visualizations (bowling averages across the cities). 
						Initially, I have sketched the visualizations by hand and then have
						converted a neater version of them using the <a href="https://infogram.com" target="_blank">
						Infogram</a> wireframing tool. 
						<br><br>
						Below, I have paired the wireframes together so that the first 
						wireframe in the pair is hand sketched by me and the wireframe that
						follows the hand sketch is generated by Infogram.

						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Step 4: Test the solution</h2>
						<br>
						
						To test my sketches and wireframes, I contacted 3 people with various 
						backgrounds. I contacted 2 cricket enthusiasts and 1 non-cricket 
						enthusiast so that I could get the views of both these types of 
						people and could understand how my sketches reach out to them. All
						3 interviewees that I chose were from different countries and had 
						different professions. I shared with each one of them, the original 
						visualizations and the wireframes generated in Infogram to review.
						I have detailed my interactions with the interviewees below.

						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Insights from the Interviews</h2>
						
						<br>
						<b>Similarities</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The bar charts are better than the tree maps.
							</li>
							<li>
								The intended audience for the visualizations is cricket	enthusiasts. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The sketches have improved the original visualizations.
							</li>
							<li>
								The ordering of the bars in the bowling averages chart
								was misleading. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The main idea of the visualizations was clear from the 
								titles in the sketches. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<b>Differences</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The first interviewee focused on improving the colors in the 
								visualizations. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The second interviewee focused on the ordering of the bars in the
								bar charts. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The third interviewee, being a data analyst, focused on a lot of 
								aspects of the visualizations such a labels, legends, titles, 
								sub-titles, and the organization of various elements in these
								visualizations.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<b>What patterns emerge in the feedback?</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Bar charts are better than the tree maps for this context. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Sketches have improved the original visualizations.
							</li>
							<li>
								Ordering of the bars in the bowling averages chart
								is misleading.
							</li>
							<li>
								The titles in the sketches were in conveying the main message 
								of the charts. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<b>What did you learn from the feedback?</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Effective titles are very useful in conveying the main 
								message of the visualizations. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Heights can be misleading in visualizations and should be
								used carefully.
							</li>
							<li>
								Even big companies like ESPNcricinfo can produce poor
								visualizations.
							</li>
							<li>
								(My favorite) This course is super relevant
								and important to me :)
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Step 5: Build your solution</h2>
						
						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Design Changes after the Interviews</h2>
					
						<ul>
							<li>
								I used Flourish to build my final visualizations.
							</li>
							<li>
								I removed the tree maps from my choice. 
							</li>
							<li>
								I added the word 'Country' in bold to help the audience 
								better understand the legends.   
							</li>
							<li>
								Since the bars in the bowling average bar chart were 
								misleading, I reversed the order of the bars to have
								lower bowling averages at the left and the higher 
								bowling averages towards the right. 
							</li>
							<li>
								However, just reversing the order of the bars in the 
								bowling average bar chart was not enough. I had to convey 
								that lower bowling averages and higher batting
								averages are better. To do so, I updated the title of 
								my y-axis in both the bar charts to the following -
								<i>Batting Average (higher the better)</i> and
								<i>Bowling Average (lower the better)</i>.
							</li>
							<li>
								I added a footer defining batting average and bowling 
								average to help these visualizations connect to a broader 
								audience. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Updated Visualizations after the Interviews</h2>

						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Step 6: In-class peer review and feedback</h2>
					
						<br>
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What worked? ü§©</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								The use of color worked extremely well. The decision of coloring the bars
								based on the national cricket colors of the respective countries was well 
								appreciated. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The visualizations would be suitable for even those people who are not big
								fans of cricket. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What didn't work? üòï</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								The font size of the y-axis title was too small. The words, <i>'higher the better'</i>
								and <i>'lower the better'</i> are of key importance in charts and should be 
								highlighted properly. 
							</li>
							<li>
								It was initially suggested to increase the font size of the y-axis title. But later,
								the peers suggested to highlight these words in the subtitles of the charts since
								they play a big role in conveying the message. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The numbers in the bars are not distracting but it is better to keep them at the
								top of the bars rather than inside the bars. This would make the bars entirely 
								visible. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The footers seems to be hanging below. Since they are defining important terms in 
								the charts, they can be connected to the Batting Average and Bowling Average by using 
								an asterisk (*) symbol.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What questions came up? üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								Pretty much none! 
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 3px;">What new inspiration arose? üòÉ</p> 

						<ul>
							<li>
								Linking the national cricket team color to the bars was found insightful!
							</li>
							<li>
								The theme of circket was interesting to all the peers since mostly nobody
								knew about cricket before. It lead to some fun discussions later on. 
							</li>
						</ul>
					
						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Step 7: Final solution</h2>
					
						<br>
						<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline" style="color: SteelBlue; font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Changes for the Final Re-Design</h2>
					
						<ul>
							<li>
								I added a subtitle for the respective bar charts to highlight the fact that
								higher batting averages and lower bowling averages are better. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The font size of the title of the y-axis was increased.  
							</li>
							<li>
								The words, <i>(higher the better)</i> and <i>(lower the better)</i> were 
								removed from the respective y-axis titles. 
							</li>
							<li>
								The y-axis titles were connected to the footer notes using an 
								asterisk (*) symbol.
							</li>
							<li>
								The numbers inside the bars were moved outside, to the top of the bars.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
